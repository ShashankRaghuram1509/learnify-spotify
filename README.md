Authentication Endpoints
POST /api/auth/login: This endpoint is used for user login. The frontend sends the user's email and password in the request body. The backend authenticates the user and, if successful, returns a JSON response containing a JWT token and user information.

POST /api/auth/register and /api/auth/signup: These endpoints are for user registration. The frontend sends the user's name, email, and password. The backend creates a new user, generates a JWT token, and returns it along with user data.

Course Endpoints
GET /api/courses: Retrieves a list of all courses. This is used in the Courses.tsx component to display the course catalog.

GET /api/courses/{id}: Fetches details for a specific course by its ID. This is used on the course detail page to display information about a single course.

GET /api/courses/featured: Returns a list of featured courses, used in the FeaturedCourses.tsx component.

GET /api/courses/category/{category}: Retrieves courses belonging to a specific category.

Enrollment Endpoints
GET /api/enrollments/user: Fetches the courses a user is currently enrolled in.

POST /api/enrollments/{courseId}: Allows a user to enroll in a course. The backend checks if the user is authenticated and if the course requires a premium subscription.

GET /api/enrollments/check/{courseId}: Checks if the current user is enrolled in a specific course.

Premium Endpoints
POST /api/premium/subscribe: Handles premium subscription payments. The frontend sends payment details, and the backend processes the subscription.

POST /api/premium/ai-assistant: Sends a message to the AI assistant and receives a response.

POST /api/premium/schedule-call: Schedules a video call with an instructor.

GET /api/premium/scheduled-calls: Retrieves a list of scheduled video calls for the user.

Frontend and Backend API Connection Analysis
The frontend application, built with React and TypeScript, communicates with a Java Spring Boot backend. Here's a summary of their interaction:

API Base URL: The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at /api, which is set up in the application.properties file. This base path is used for all API requests.

Authentication Flow:

The user logs in or registers through the AuthForm.tsx component, which sends requests to the /api/auth/login or /api/auth/register endpoints.

The AuthController.java class on the backend handles these requests, using Spring Security for authentication.

Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated by JwtTokenUtil.java and sent back to the client.

Authenticated Requests:

For endpoints that require authentication (like enrolling in a course), the frontend includes the JWT token in the Authorization header of the request.

The JwtRequestFilter.java on the backend intercepts these requests, validates the token, and sets the user's authentication context.

CORS Configuration: The backend has CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configured in CorsConfig.java and SecurityConfig.java to allow requests from the frontend, which runs on http://localhost:8080.

Services: The frontend uses services like auth.service.ts and courses.service.ts to abstract the API calls, making the code cleaner and easier to manage.
